`dmm` is a simple CLI tool to bump your dependencies from your `deps.ts` to
their latest versions.

### Features

- Zero 3rd party dependencies
- Easy and simple to use
- Will update your dependencies for you
- Accounts for 3rd party and Deno Standard modules
- Installation is optional
- No variants of `node_modules` and `package.json`
- No extra configuration around import maps

### Getting Started

Get started [here](https://drash.land/dmm/#/#quickstart) with a basic example.

### How It Works

dmm reads the `deps.ts` file at the current working directory -- checking
versioned `import` and `export` statements and checking to see if they can be
updated. If any dependency can be updated, it lets you know which ones can be
updated; and if you want to update them, dmm will rewrite your `deps.ts` file so
that your dependencies reflect their latest versions.

_Note: nest.land may not reflect the latest Deno Standard Modules version
immediately after Deno releases a new version. Please keep this in mind when
importing your modules via nest.land._
